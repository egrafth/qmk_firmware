# The Thogra Planck Layout

This keymap not only defines a special keymap layout but also some cool features like methods and structs that might be useful for many purposes.

## The Keyboard Layout

### Background

I am a german programmer and I wanted to use the Planck as my daily driver. In my opinion the german keyboard layout is really bad for doing programming. Anyway, I still want to have all features of the german os keyboard available (like ae).

This means that I always want to have the us style keyboard available if the Planck is connected with a pc that uses the us or german language.

Furthermore, I am mot perfectly satisfied with the default Planck layout. For example, I want to change the backspace to delete if I press shift. 

### Base layout

I always use the same layout (if the Planck is connected to a us or german pc):

| *Base*    |          |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Tab**   | Q        | W         | E         | R         | T         | Y         | U         | I         | O         | P         | **Bksp (Del)** |
| **Esc**   | A        | S         | D         | F         | G         | H         | J         | K         | L         | ; (:)     | ' (")      |
| **Shift** | Z        | X         | C         | V         | B         | N         | M         | , (<)     | . (>)     | / (?)     | **Enter**  |
| **Brite** | **Ctrl** | **Alt**   | **GUI**   | **Lower** | **Shift** | **Space** | **Raise** | **Left**  | **Down**  | **Up**    | **Right**  |

The characters in '()' are the characters that are send if the key is pressed with 'shift'.
